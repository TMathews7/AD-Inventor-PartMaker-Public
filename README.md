Hello, 

I am not planning to release this publicly or help people set this up themselves, 
  This is automation software so I leave a lot of the very complicated stuff out of the public document for ethical reasons
I will update this ocasionally but my private github is the one that recieves most updates as I can update it with no concerns

I will not leave functions or documents out I will simply leave them basically blank.
  Example is my curve finder,
    The curve finder can find any curve you want essentially so long as its straight
      I plan to keep improving it until I can select any curve with the api i want

For this reason this github bit doesnt get updated much 

Apologies,
