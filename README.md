Hello,

This file is not planned to be released publically or anything of the likes
I am simply learning to use the Autodesk Inventor API, and learning VB.net

The MarshHelper in my code is not mine, I am unsure where I found it otherwise I would link it here.

As of current here are the things I am planning to implement,

Beyond that I plan to convert all CM inputs to MM, and to add a checkbox that allows you to use imperial units rather than metric.
